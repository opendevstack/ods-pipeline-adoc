= ods-pipeline-adoc-render

The purpose of this task is to render a asciidoc template located in the repository into a PDF. In addition to just transforming the asciidoc file to PDF, the task is also able to render information gathered from YAML/JSON files (such as ODS Pipeline artifacts) into the asciidoc file before transforming it to PDF.

The task expects a glob pattern pointing to one or more Go template files (given by parameter `template`). It renders each found Go template with data gathered from files matching the `data-sources` parameter, which defaults to `artifacts:.ods/artifacts/\*/*.json;artifacts:.ods/artifacts/\*/*.yaml`. The asciidoc template can then access data parsed from these files under the key specified before the colon of each glob pattern. For example, if file `.ods/artifacts/org.foo/some.json` contains:

```
{"a":"b"}
```

The asciidoc template can access the value of the field `a` by referencing `{{.artifacts.org_foo.some.a}}`. Note that any non-alphanumeric character in the file path is replaced with an underscore. In general, field access in templates is possible via `<key>.<path>.<file>.<field>`. In the special case where the file is located at the root of the directory, the `<path>` section is set to `root`. For example, the glob pattern `metadata:*.yaml` might match the file `foo.yaml` in the root of the repository - its data will be accessible as `metadata.root.foo.fieldname`.

Note that only JSON and YAML formats are recognized. If a matching file does not end in either `.json` or `.y(a)ml`, its entire content is made available under the key `value`. For example, the glob pattern `log:*.log` might match the file `pipeline-run.log`, which would expose the content of the file as `log.root.pipeline_run.value` to the template.

After the Go template has been rendered, link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[asciidoctor-pdf] is used to turn each rendered asciidoc file into a PDF file. The resulting files are placed into the directory specified by `output-dir` (defaulting to `.ods/artifacts/org.opendevstack.pipeline.adoc.pdf` so that created PDFs are preserved as artifacts in Nexus). Theming is possible by specifying the `pdf-theme` parameter as explained in the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/theme/apply-theme/#theme-and-font-directories[Theme and font directories] documentation.


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| template
| 
| Glob pattern from where to source templates.


| output-dir
| .ods/artifacts/org.opendevstack.pipeline.adoc.pdf
| Output directory where to place the rendered PDF files.


| data-sources
| artifacts:.ods/artifacts/*/*.json;artifacts:.ods/artifacts/*/*.yaml
| Glob patterns from where to source data. Multiple glob patterns are separated by semicolons. Each glob pattern must specify a key, followed by a colon, followed by the pattern. The key is used to disambiguate the parsed data in the Go templates.


| pdf-theme
| 
| The name or file path of the Asciidoctor PDF theme to load.

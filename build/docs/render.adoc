The purpose of this task is to render a asciidoc template located in the repository into a PDF. In addition to just transforming the asciidoc file to PDF, the task is also able to render information, for example gathered from YAML/JSON/XML files such as ODS Pipeline artifacts, into the asciidoc file before transforming it to PDF.

The task expects a glob pattern pointing to one or more link:https://pkg.go.dev/text/template[Go template] files (given by parameter `template`). The templates can make use of template functions provided by link:http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/[sprig], as well as the following helper functions:

* `data`. Parses a `.y(a)ml`, `.json` or `.xml` file into a map. Example: `{{$metadata := data "metadata.yaml"}}`
* `content`. Reads the content of the given file. Example: `{{content ".ods/project"}}`
* `contents`. Reads the content of all files matching the given glob pattern. Example: `{{$ods := contents ".ods/*"}}`
* `files`. Returns a slice of files at given path. Example: `{{$images := data ".ods/artifacts/image-digests/*"}}`
* `directories`. Returns a slice of directories at given path. Example: `{{$repos := data ".ods/repos"}}`
* `exists`. Checks whether given path exists. Example: `{{if exists ".ods/artifacts/foo/bar.json"}}artifact exists{{end}}`
* `fromMultiYAML`. Turns a string of multiple YAML documents (separated with `---`) into a slice of maps. Example: `{{$manifest := fromMultiYAML $helm_status.manifest}}`
* `toYAML`. Turns the given object into a YAML string. Example: `{{toYAML $helm_status.config}}`
* `toSentence`. Turns a slice into a string enumerating its items. The words are connected with commas, except for the last two words, which are connected with "and". Example: `{{toSentence $repos}}`

After the Go template has been rendered, link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[asciidoctor-pdf] is used to turn each rendered asciidoc file into a PDF file. The resulting files are placed into the directory specified by `output-dir` (defaulting to `.ods/artifacts/org.opendevstack.pipeline.adoc.pdf` so that created PDFs are preserved as artifacts in Nexus). Theming is possible by specifying the `pdf-theme` parameter as explained in the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/theme/apply-theme/#theme-and-font-directories[Theme and font directories] documentation.

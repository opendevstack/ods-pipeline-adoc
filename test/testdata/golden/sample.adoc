# Hello World

This is a sample adoc file.

Actually, it is a Go template, with some placeholders like:

* a
* b
* x

Also with longer text:
some random text here ...

Even nested things work:

Hello world!

And other keys can be passed as well:

bar

Sprig template functions can be used:
31/12/2017

And custom helper functions can be used:
bar: b
foo: a

Here's another one:

project-foo
component-foo

It is also possible to use values set from the CLI:
valbar and valbaz
